## Dynamic Parameters Of Human Gait

This project creates a WPF application that uses a Kinect sensor to track and visualize human movement in real-time. The MainWindow.xaml.cs file contains the core logic, which processes Kinect sensor data to calculate and display velocity, swing arc length, and stride length of a tracked person. It uses the OxyPlot library to create live-updating graphs of these measurements over time. The application also classifies the person's activity (standing, walking, or running) based on their velocity and swing length. The MainWindow.xaml file defines the user interface, which includes a video feed from the Kinect, three graph plots (for velocity, swing arc, and stride length), and text displays for current measurements and activity classification. The interface also includes a button to save swing data to a text file. This application could be useful for sports training, physical therapy, or general motion analysis.
